Write this...

Things to cover:

* formatters as pure functions for easy testing.  Don't couple to OutputStream or HttpResponse
* don't use reflection
* validating output against JSON schemas (if we have published them)
* approval tests to verify that values from the domain objects end up in the right JSON properties of the message
