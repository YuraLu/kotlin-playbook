# Testing code that parses data from the network

Write this...

Things to cover:
 * parsers as pure functions for easy testing
 * parsing incoming requests vs responses to outgoing requests
 * validating test input against JSON schemas (if we have published them)
 * fuzz testing (e.g. with Snodge)
